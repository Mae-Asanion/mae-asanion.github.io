    			<h1>How to Make Your School Paper More Interesting</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p style="text-align: justify">There are plenty characteristics of a good essay: original thinking, a tight structure, balanced arguments, and some more.
				However, one aspect often overlooked is that a good essay ought to be interesting. It should spark the interest of the readers,
				keep them absorbed, make them want to continue to reading and learn more. A boring essay increases the chances of losing the 
				reading's attention; regardless of whether the points you make are excellent, a dull writing style or poor handling of a dry 
				subject matter can undermine the positive aspects of the essay. The issue or problem is that numerous students thought that 
				essays ought to be this way: they imagine that a dull, dry style is fit to the purposes of academic writing, and don't 
				consider that the teacher reading their paper needs to find the essay interesting. Academic writing doesn't need to be – and
				shouldn't be – boring. Fortunately there are a lot of things you can do to make your writing more interesting, despite the 
				fact that you can only do a lot while remaining within the formal confines of academic writing. Let's take a look at what 
				they are.</p>
				
				<h2>1. Be interested in what you’re writing about</h2>
				
				<figure>

				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic1.jpg" />
				<figcaption>Try not to go over the edge, however you can let your passion for your subject show.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">If there's one thing guaranteed to inject interest into your writing, it's actually being interested on the thing you're 
				writing about. Passion for a subject comes across naturally in your composition, typically making it all the more lively and 
				engaging, and mixing an infectious enthusiasm into your words – similarly that it's not difficult to chat knowledgeably to
				someone about something you find interesting. This makes it relatively easy to write interestingly regarding a matter you have
				a real passion for. Nonetheless, problems emerge when you're forced to write a paper about subjects for which you lack 
				enthusiasm. It's hard to invoke passion for your least favorite subjects, and that will come across in your writing. There 
				are steps you can take, however: here are a few tips on writing about a subject you least enjoy.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Adjust your mindset</b>: convince yourself that there are no boring subjects. If the subject or essay seems to be 
					boring, the fault is in yourself; If you wind up feeling negatively about it, try to discover the interest in it. Consider
					how it relates to the reality and how significant the subject is. Find interesting snippets of information about it and 
					take a look at it from another point.</li>
					
					<li><b>Think about your reader</b>: consider the fact that not every person will find the subject as boring as you do. As
					you write, remember the reader and imagine them to be the world's greatest enthusiast of this subject.</li>
					
					<li><b>Find the fans</b>: if you think that its not possible to get into the mindset of your audience, try Googling the
					subject to find forums, videos or blog post in which the subject is talked about by individuals who do think that its 
					interesting. This will help you picture whom you're writing for, and give you an alternate point of view regarding a 
					subject you might not have found inspiring to now.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>2. Include fascinating details</h2>
				
				<figure>

				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic2.jpg" />
				<figcaption>Focus on any interesting details.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Another factor that can make an essay boring is a dry topic. A few subjects or topic areas are naturally dry, and it falls 
				to you to make the essay more interesting through your writing style and by attempting to discover fascinating snippets of 
				information to include that will liven it up a bit and make the information simpler to relate with. One method of doing this 
				with a dry subject is to try to make what you're talking about seem to be relevant to the reality, as this is easier for the 
				reader to relate with. In a discussion of an apparently boring piece of legislation, for example, you could comment something 
				in accordance with the lines of "if it were not for this legislation, none of us would enjoy the freedom to do such today", or
				"Legislation A ultimately paved the way for Legislation B, which transformed criminal law as far as we know it." Make it 
				appear to be exciting!<p>
				
				<h2>3. Emulate the style of writers you find interesting</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">When you read a lot, you subconsciously begin emulating the style of the writers you read. It's therefore helpful
				to read widely, as this opens you to a range of styles and you can start to take on the characteristics of those you
				find interesting to read. If you feel engaged with a piece of writing, the writer must be something right! As you
				read, think how the writer is doing hold your interest, maybe underlining or copying certain phrases, techniques, 
				sentence structures, and so on. Then at that point apply their techniques to your own writing.</p>
				
				<h2>4. Write in the active voice</h2>
				
				<figure>

				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic3.jpg" />
				<figcaption>If the scientists are doing something active – concluding, analysing, researching – you should avoid the 
				passive voice.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">It's the oldest trick in the book, but using the active rather than the passive voice will naturally make your 
				writing more interesting to read. It results in more straightforward, energetic writing that causes the reader to 
				feel more 'in the moment'. Sadly, numerous students employ the passive voice in the belief that it makes their 
				writing sound more academic or intellectual; when in fact, it makes their writing sound boring. Keep in mind, the 
				active voice is the point at which the subject of the sentence "acts", while the passive voice is the point at which
				the subject is acted upon.<br>			

				<b>Passive</b>: It was concluded by the scientist that the method used were…<br>

				<b>Active</b>: The scientist concluded that the method used were…<br> 

				The subject in this example is "the scientist" and the "act" they are carrying out is "concluding". As you can see 
				in this example, the active voice quite often brings about neater and more elegant phrasing, which is more concise 
				and enjoyable to read.</p>
				
				<h2>5. Borrow some creative writing techniques</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">There's clearly a limit to the amount of actual 'story-telling' you can do when you're writing a paper; all 
				things considered, essays ought to be objective, factual and balanced, which doesn't, at the first look, feel very
				much like story-telling. However, you can apply some of the principles of story-telling to make your more 
				interesting. For instance, similarly as the opening sentence or paragraph section of a novel is incredibly important
				in catching the attention of the reader right off the bat, so the first paragraph of your essay is essential in 
				making your reader want to keep reading it. Start with an attention grabbing 'hook' to draw them, like a 
				controversial statement, an enticing bit of information or a rhetorical question Here are some more techniques you 
				can adopt from creative writing to improve your essays.</p>
				
				<h2>6. Think about your own opinion</h2>
				
				<figure>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic4.jpg" />
				<figcaption>Take the time to work out what it is that you think, rather than regurgitating the opinions of 
				others.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Your essay is bound to be boring if everything you do is paraphrase what every other person says about something. 
				A good essay – in humanities subjects, at least – includes the writer's intelligent responses to what others say, 
				and this critical consideration not just shows that you're thinking at a high academic level, but it automatically 
				adds more interest and originality to your writing. Along these lines, think independently and don't be afraid to 
				show that you're doing as much.</p>
			
				<h2>7. Cut the waffle</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Rambling on and on is boring, and nearly ensured to lose the interest of your reader. You're at risk of waffling 
				If you're not totally clear about what you need to say, or if that you haven't thought how you will structure your 
				argument. Doing your research appropriately and writing an essay plan before you start will help you prevent this 
				problem.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Editing is an important part of the essay writing process, so whenever you've done a first draft, edit out the 
				waffle. Read your essay objectively and take out the bits that isn't relevant to the argument or that work the point.
				Just as editing out chunks of text, it's important to be conservative with words – not using ten where five will do,
				and keeping away from clunky phrases like those illustrated in this article. During the editing process, tighten out
				your phrasing by eliminating of unnecessary words and reordering any sentences that read gravely.</p>
				
				<h2>8. Using a thesaurus isn’t always a good thing</h2>
				
				<figure>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic5.jpg" />
				<figcaption>Avoid using words that are entirely new to you in an essay; there’s too great an likelihood that you’re 
				using them incorrectly.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">You may think that using a thesaurus to find more complicated words will make your writing fascinating, or sound 
				more academic, but using excessively high-brow language can have wrong effect. It alienates the reader and makes you
				sound pompous, with the result that the essay is more laborious to read and the reader may rapidly lose interest. 
				Regardless of this, numerous students admit to purposely over-complicate their language to make it sound all the 
				more high-brow. If you want to keep your reader interested, keep your language clear and straightforward.</p>
				
				<h2>9. Avoid repetitive phrasing</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Avoid using similar sentence structure over and over: it's a recipe for dullness! instead, use a range of syntax 
				that shows your writing abilities just as making your writing more interesting. Blend simple, compound and complex 
				sentences to avoid from your writing getting predictable.</p>
				
				<h2>10. Use some figurative language</h2>
				
				<figure>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic6.jpg" />
				<figcaption>Using analogies with the natural world can often make concepts easier for readers to
				understand.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">As we've already seen, it's not difficult to end up rambling when you're explaining difficult ideas or concepts, 
				– especially when you don't clearly understand it yourself. A method of forcing yourself to think clearly about a 
				concept, just as explaining it all the more simply and engagingly, is to utilize figurative language. This means
				explaining something by comparing it and something else, as in an analogy. For example, you may use the analogy of
				water scaping from a hole in a can to explain the exponential decay of a radioactive substance, as the rate of 
				depletion of both relies upon how much remains, making it exponential. This gives the reader something familiar to 
				picture, making it simpler for them to understand new concept (obviously this won't be another new concept for the 
				instructor who set your essay, however they will need to see that you can explain concepts clearly and that you have
				a thorough grasp of it yourself).</p>
				
				<h2>11. Avoid clichés</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Clichés are overused words or phrases that make your writing unsurprising, and therefore less interesting. An 
				example would be "at the end of the day", but there are numerous such favorites of student essay-writers. Remember 
				that your teacher will have a pile of papers to read at a time; if you use similar tired expressions every other 
				person uses, your essay will mix in with all the others. Make it stand out by avoiding the clichés you know your 
				classmates will be use.</p>
				
				<h2>12. Employ rhetorical questions</h2>
				
				<figure>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/How to make your school paper more interesting_pic7.jpg" />
				<figcaption>Anticipate the questions your reader might ask.</figcaption>
				
				</figure>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">One of the ways in which ancient speakers held the attention of their audiences and increased the dramatic effect
				of their speeches was by using the rhetorical question. What is a rhetorical question? It's basically one you ask 
				without expecting that your audience would answer – one that you will answer yourself, similar to the one we asked 
				in the previous sentence. This can be an effective method of introducing another line of enquiry, or of bringing up 
				question that you will address in more detail. A good place to use a rhetorical question is toward the finish of a 
				paragraph, to lead into the next one, or toward the start of another paragraph to introduce another area for 
				exploration. The rhetorical question, "But is there any evidence to support X's claim?" could, for instance, start a 
				paragraph that discusses evidence for an opinion presented in the previous paragraph. What's more, as we've already 
				seen, you could utilize a rhetorical question as your 'hook' to lure readers in directly toward the start of your 
				essay.</p>
				
				<h2>13. Proofread</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">At long last, you could write the most interesting essay a teacher has ever read, however you'll undermine your 
				great work if it's covered with errors, which distract the reader from the actual content and will presumably bother
				them. Before you submit your paper, proofread it thoroughly to guarantee that the grammar is rich, the punctuation 
				is great and the spelling is flawless. Don't simply use a spelling and grammar checker, as these don't generally get
				on every one of the errors.</p>
