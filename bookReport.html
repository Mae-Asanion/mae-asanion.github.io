    			<h1>Writing the Perfect Book Report</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve ever struggled writing a book report before, here are some tips and tricks on how to write the ultimate book report and pass that English class!
    			</p>
                <img src="IMAGES/book report.png" style=" margin-left: 200px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Read before you write. </b> Pick a book you’ll enjoy reading (unless you’ve been assigned a book) and don’t cut shortcuts when going through it to help you with the book report. It’s best to read with a pen and paper at hand so you can write down page numbers and notes about significant passages. </p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Take note of the book report outline. </b>These are 1) introduction, 2) summary of the book, 3) book details: characters, 4) book details: plot, and 5) evaluation and conclusion. These are usually the main key points your teacher may be looking for unless they state their own instructions and components to follow. </p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Introducing your report. </b> The opening paragraph is the opportunity to build interest to capture your audience. Try to start by mentioning unusual facts about writing the book or noteworthy credentials of the author. Apart from that, there is also nothing bad with not deviating from the established norms where you mention the book’s title, author, genre, and publication information. </p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Writing the body of the book report. </b> Here is the part where you dive in detail the different parts of the book and where you can showcase what you’ve read and understood from the book. Here are some specific tips on accomplishing them.</p> </li>
                <ul style="padding-left: 70px;">
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;"> <b> Summary: </b> Give an overview of the story. Mention the setting, the time period, main characters, and plot. Specify who tells the story and indicate the tone/atmosphere of the book.</p> </li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;"> <b> Character details: </b> You don’t have to list all the characters that appeared in it. The main characters along with the other side character that played a part with turning points should be enough. You may also describe the major conflict the main characters are trying to solve when introducing them.</p> </li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;"> <b> Plot details: </b> Like the character details, you don’t have to mention every detail that happened in the story. Focus on the main sequence of events, discuss plot highlights, distinguish the rising action, the climax, and resolution parts of the book. Make sure you include and mention the author’s use of any literary devices you’ve been studying in class. </p> </li>
            </ul>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Book reports on non-fiction. </b> In case you’re writing a book report for a biography and other factual text, you’ll want to focus on the description of the book’s subject and the author’s point of view. Use the titles of each chapter to help you present the author’s ideas and arguments in an orderly manner. If you’re working on a biography, present and write about some of the significant events that happened in that person’s life. </p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Personal Evaluation and Conclusion. </b>Offer your own critique of the book. Ask yourself questions like how did the book affect you?, what did you learn from the book?, what are the book’s strengths and weaknesses?. Support your statements from passages from the book and give your honest opinion and whether or not you recommend it to others. </p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Revising, editing, and publishing. </b> Last but not the least, review your own work! Check your grammar and be sure to revisit your other key points before turning in your report.</p> </li>
