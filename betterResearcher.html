    			<h1>Ways on How to Become a Better Researcher </h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">Every student has dreaded writing their own research paper. It's not exactly a piece of cake, but here are some ways on how to become a better researcher to help you be equipped and face making that thesis paper to help you pass!
    			</p>
                <img src="IMAGES/researcher.jpg" style=" margin-left: 270px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">

                <ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Learn the use of research engine shortcuts </b> Being able to utilize search engine tools properly will help us extract the piece of information we are looking for. This is achievable when you place specific search terms to successfully navigate through the immense ocean of information available on the net. <br> <br>
                Make use of quotation marks in your search terms to ensure Google searchers for the whole phrase and not just occurrences. This will ensure that Google shows you the most relevant pages.<br> <br>
                Exclude words with a hyphen to remove words related to its meaning and only return relevant results. Let’s say you are searching for the term ‘toast’ meaning to give a speech in its context however results related to breakfast foods may appear as well. Simply type ‘toast –breakfast’ so that way the results containing the term breakfast will be eliminated. <br> <br>
                Another helpful tip is when you make use of searching for specific sites related to the topic you’re working with by simply adding the term ‘site’ to it.</p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Check your sources </b>“Don’t believe everything you read on the internet”. The circulation of fake news have been constant these days which is why it is important to have some sort of strategy to assess the accuracy and validity of the information we come across. Try asking yourself these questions when stumbling upon new information:  </p> </li>
                <ul style="padding-left: 120px;">
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;"> Is this information up-to-date?</p></li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;">Is this information detailed? </p> </li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;">Is the author identified?</p> </li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;">Is the author qualified in the topic?</p></li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;">Are sources cited? </p></li>
                    <li> <p style="margin-left: -45px;">Does the information come from a trusted source?</p>    </li>
                </ul>
                 <img src="IMAGES/search engine.jpeg" style=" margin-left: 180px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Select domains wisely. </b> Check the domains of the websites you come across and be familiar with their differences. “.com” and “.org” domains are usually ‘open’ where anyone can register on them since they are typically used for commercial reason. Meanwhile “.gov” and “.edu” domains are considered ‘closed’ where registrants must meet certain qualifications for these. Depending on the purpose of your search, the domain you choose to search may have implications for the reliability and usefulness of the results returned. To choose which type of domain to search, simply type ‘site’, followed by a colon, and then the domain after your chosen search terms. For example, if you wish to search for the term ‘American presidents’ on .edu sites, simply type:  American presidents site:edu</p> </li>
                <li> <p style="margin-left: -50px;"> <b> Citation. </b> When engaging in writing essays, students should learn how to use quotation marks, compile notes, and a structure bibliography. We must learn to avoid plagiarism and recognize copyright rights where credit is due. Plagiarism is a form of theft which is why it is always best to paraphrase researches into your own words and place the citation from the original source.</p> </li>
