    			<h1>Study Tips</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">"Regardless of whether it is back to school time or any time of the school year, studying equals to academic achievement. 
				however, a few students don't have the idea how to study. after watching countless middles school students struggle throughout
				the years, I've made a top 10 list of how students can deal with the improvement of study habits.</p>
				
				<h2>10. Select a consistent place to study</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Some people need total quite while others can concentrate well with music in the background. The key is to find a
				comfortable place and study there regularly, for example, the kitchen table, a desk, a most loved chair, bed, and so forth.</p>
				
				<h2>9. Donâ€™t wait until the last minute</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Study a little consistently every night instead of cramming late the night prior to the test. A good night's sleep help. 
				Dim eyes and a drained body don't.</p>
				
				<h2>8. Buy an plan book and use it</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Most students have a plan book, yet they don't write anything in it. On Monday, record the entirety of the week's tasks. 
				Most teachers have them posted in the classroom.</p>
				
				<h2>7. Dedicate a space for every class in your book bag</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Keep papers separated by class with a binder. There should be a place for class notes, handouts and assignments. A portion 
				of the bigger binder can accommodate all classes. It is actually a matter of personal choice; simply keep papers separated by 
				class.</p>
				
				<h2>6. Stay organized throughout the year</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Most students have numerous binders and folders, however they don't utilize them. Many stuff each and every paper from 
				school into one binder. half of their papers become misplaced or lost. Try not to use the "shove" method when papers are 
				returned, for example shove everything in one binder. place them in the right folder. In the event that you are using a 
				three-ring binder to keep papers organized, take the time to open the metal prongs and place them safely in it. if someone 
				helps you with organize your papers, take the time to continue putting everything in its place.</p>
				
				<h2>5. Make study cards</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">On the front of a note card write the word or idea. On the back, write the definition or important information. Have a 
				friend or parent ask to get some information about the word as well as give a definition. (Digital flashcards like Quizlet and 
				Studystack can likewise be used.)</p>
				
				<h2>4. Make your own study guide</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">One great approach to study is to make a list of the important information from a chapter and write it in your own words. 
				Duplicate down any words that are written in bold or in italics. Take a look at chapter headings, section headings and review
				sections toward the finish of a chapter for other important information to add to your study guide. merge this information 
				with class notes.</p>
				
				<h2>3. Talk about assignments with friends</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Discussing assignments with friends is another great method to study. This is useful when reading for novel tests. friendly
				conversations about books help extend understanding.</p>
				
				<h2>2. If you are struggling, ask for help</h2>

				<p style="text-align: justify">Start by speaking with the teacher. The guidance counselor generally has a list of tutors around the area. Some high school
				students need to finish community service hours to be in clubs or in honor societies. You might be able to get a free 
				tutor.</p>

				<h2>1. Make academics a focus in your life</h2>

				<p style="text-align: justify">Studying requires time and effort. Get organized, ask for help and set forth effort aimed toward improving your study
				habits now.</p>
				
				<h2>Lesson Learnt</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">The lessons taught in middle school are building blocks for high school and college. Starting great study habits now will 
				help you further down the road. It requires more effort to study and to become organized; however, academic success will cause
				you to have a positive outlook on yourself and your parents smile.</p>
