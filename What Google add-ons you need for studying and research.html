    			<h1>Google Extensions for Students</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Beginning another school year means new students, new supplies, a newly cleaned and organized
			classroom—and new technology tools for students. Each child has a different combination of extensions attached to their 
			account to suit their individual learning needs. It takes a short time for students to become comfortable utilizing their 
			extensions and we ordinarily set aside some time to test and get familiar with the tools.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">These are some of the majorities of students favorite and most-used extensions throughout the school year.</p>
			
			<h2>Chrome Extensions That Students Will Really Use</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Google Dictionary</b>(free): Sometimes articles in content region classes can be challenging, particularly when students are 
			faced with unknown words. While they could open another tab and run a search for these words, this extension offers a lot 
			simpler alternative that doesn't disturb a student's work process. The student can double tap on any word in a text to see a 
			small pop-up window with a definition, and they can hear the way to pronounce the word.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Dualless</b> (free): Dualless is a productivity extension that is a perpetual top choice of some students. It permits a user to
			split their screen so they can work in two tabs at the same time. For example, if a student needs to watch a video review of a
			leasson, they can open and view it in one tab while taking notes in Google Docs simultaneously.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Dualless is very easy to use, and students can set the relative sizes of the different sides—they aren't left with a 50-50 
			split. They have a choice of splitting the screen either on a horizontal or vertically.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Grammarly for Chrome</b> (free, offers some premium options): Most students use the free version of this famous grammar checker.
			At the point when they're typing anywhere in Chrome, a small, green icon shows up and Grammarly starts to check the
			grammar and spelling of their work. On the off chance that there's a mistake, it is underlined in red, and the student can see
			the type of error they made and correct it.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">In addition, Grammarly gathers the students' most common mistakes all throughout a given week and emails them the list, 
			providing their writing statistics and areas of focus.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>VoiceIn Voice Typing</b> (free): A lot of students are fans of voice typing, and this extension is our go-to support in the 
			classroom. It works anywhere in Chrome—the students simply puts their cursor where they want to start typing, activates 
			the expansion, and begins to talk. At the point when they finish talking, the extension drops the text at the cursor. students
			can either dictate the punctuation or add it later. The extension works with more than 120 language.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Noisli</b> (free): Many students enjoy tuning in to music when they're working, but for some it's a distraction. Noisli 
			is perfect for those students. They can experiment with listening to ambient sounds like rain, a forest setting, or a café to
			see what helps them with feeling productive. students can add multiple sounds to a same track, and they can set up specific
			combinations for different independent, activities similar to Writer's Workshop or taking an assessment.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Auto Highlights</b> (free): Auto Highlight is a great tool for students who need some support with reading. At the point when 
			activated, the extension look through the text and highlights a couple of important sentences. The student can use the 
			extension two additional times on a single website page, but only one or two sentences will be added each time. This
			limitations guides students to think how to use the tool wisely—they can't simply highlight each sentence.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>AlphaText</b> (free): An all-in-one accessibility extension, AlphaText gives a variety of options for students to customize 
			their browser. They can change the background color of their screen, just as the text color, font size, and font type, for 
			ideal viewing. One thing a student can do with this tool is the ability to adjust the line spacing, changing 
			from single to 1.5 or double line separating, which can make an article simpler to read.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Mercury Reader</b> (free): Formerly known as Readability, Mercury Reader permits students to hide distracting features in online
			articles—it remove ads, comment sections, and some other content that is insignificant to the article, while keeping useful 
			highlights like photos and other images.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Diigo</b> (free, with premium alternatives): There are tons of digital sticky notes and highlighting tools out there, but
			one of the most popular is Diigo. Students are needed to create an account to save their work.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">When a student selects a section of a text, they can highlight it, add a sticky note with comments, and search the web for 
			extra information. All comments and highlight a student makes are gathered and stored within their Diigo account, and if a 
			student gets back to a page they've annotated, the highlights and comments remain. It's a good way to gather information 
			needed to finish a task, and student can share their comments and highlights to their classmates when they're working on a
			group project.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Visor</b> (free): In progressing from print to digital texts, a large number of middle school students search for a virtual
			alternative to using a bookmark to track as they read. Visor gives them that ability. It permits the students to focus on each
			line of text in time, while darkening the rest of the page. This tool helps students who struggle with line or word skipping
			and losing their place when reading.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">The important factor when adding Chrome extensions is to add just the ones you'll really need. Adding
			too many can slow the browser down, and there's no good reason for adding a tool that you will not use and needn't 
			bother with. Try to limit yourself to five tools that you will find really helpful in learning in the classroom.</p>
