    			<h1>7 Ways on How to Prepare for College Entrance Exams</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
                <p> Preparing for college entrance exams are very important. It is going to determine whether you would be qualified to attend the university you're applying to. It's not every day that you get a chance to apply so here are some tips on what to do to help you prepare! </p>
                <img src="IMAGES/entrance exam.jpg" style=" margin-left: 200px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
    			<p><b>Tip #1: Study Ahead.</b> This is an absolute must and a given. You don’t brink a knife to a gun fight and you most certainly won’t win the war without conquering a battle. Whether you study on your own or with a group of friends, maybe even in a review center, always make sure you give yourself time to study. Make the most out of your summer break to pick up a college entrance exam review book and try taking mock tests so you can also practice your speed.
    			</p>
                <p><b>Tip #2: Know Whether the Test is held online or on-site. </b> Some colleges are transitioning to online exams so it’s best to know whether you need to go to the campus or set up a workstation at home. If its on-site try to visit the campus at least once and try to look for the exam room you’re supposed to go so you won’t get lost when the day arrives. If the exam is online, make sure you check your internet connection and log onto the video link earlier than the given time. Arriving early whether it is on-site or online is important to allow yourself to calm down and mentally prepare for the exam.
                </p>
                <p><b>Tip #3: Pack the Essentials.</b> Some schools may provide you with a list of things you need to bring such as the examination fee payment, your school ID, a pencil and eraser, ballpens, in some cases even scientific calculators are allowed. Try to prepare everything you’ll need the night before the exam. Packing in the morning might cause you to forget some essentials due to “exam jitters”. Bring a bottle of water too to stay hydrated and a healthy snack to give you an energy boost you need.
                </p>
                <img src="IMAGES/sleep.jpg" style=" margin-left: 270px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <p><b>Tip #4: Get enough rest.</b> It’s not wise to pull an all-nighter the night before the exam. Sleep is more important than cramming. Lack of sleep may cause more stress and fatigue and you might risk waking up late the next day. If you’ve managed to study ahead, then you don’t need to cram and get a good night’s rest instead.
                </p>
                <p><b>Tip #5: Dress the part.</b> Studies show that choosing an outfit that helps you feel confident can help reduce anxiety levels. You may want to check the guidelines provided by the school if there’s a dress code you need to follow. And, last but not the least be sure to pick an outfit that’s comfortable for the day of the exam.
                </p>
                <p><b>Tip #6: Manage your time.</b> Wear a watch! There may be a clock at the exam center or the proctor may give time cues, but wearing a watch will make it easier for you to manage your time. Try not to skip questions and just keep answering as much correct answers as you can. Skipping questions might make you forget to go back to them when time runs out. You can just go back to these once you’re finished with the whole exam and review your answers.
                </p>
                <p><b>Tip #7: Keep calm.</b> Last but not the least, try to keep as calm as possible. It’s normal to feel stressed on the day of the exam but keeping a cool head will allow you to concentrate more on answering the questions and prevent having mental blocks during the test.
