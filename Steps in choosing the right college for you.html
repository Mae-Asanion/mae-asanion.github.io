    			<h1>Steps in Choosing the Right College for You</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
				
    			<p style="text-align: center">How to choose the right college: Consider priorities, focus on goals and enjoy the journey.</p>
			
				<h2>Develop your short list.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic1.jfif" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">A great deal of thought should go into building up a short list of schools you might want to attend in. But, what sort of 
				factors should drive your thinking while making that list? Brennan Barnard and Rick Clark, authors of "The Truth About College
				Admission: A Family Guide to Getting In and Staying Together," ask students to consider location, enrollment size, majors and
				programs, the people on the campus, opportunities outside of the classroom, cost and selectivity.</p>
				
				<h2>Rank your priorities.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic2.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Take some time and effort to make your own rankings, weighing the pros and cons of a specific school when you are dealing 
				with picking the right school. Carefully consider your wants and needs when contemplating where you'll go through the following 
				four years or more. One way to do this, write Barnard and Clark, is to make a list of those needs and needs.</p>
				
				<h2>Don't procrastinate.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic3.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Cutoff may vary upon the institution, but applications normally are expected by January for regular admission. Experts recommend 
				getting started on the application process by the start of your senior year in high school. Furthermore, plan a lot of time for school 
				visits, taking standardized test, writing essay and asking for letters of recommendation.</p>
				
				
				<h2>Go back to schools.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic4.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Once applications are in, it's time to think hard about where you need to attend, which may prompt another visit. While you should have
				figured it out how's campus life during initial college tours, go on another trip to each school and ask 10 to 15 detailed questions, says
				Bob Roth, writer of several books on college success. Know what to ask on a college visit, and don't leave with any question unanswered.
				However, taking a campus tour can be costly, considering travel costs. if a return trip is out of the question, take a second look at the
				campus via a virtual tour and contact college officials with any follow-up questions.</p>
				
				<h2>Focus on your endgame.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic5.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Ask yourself where you want to be in four years. If you can pinpoint a reasonable job and financial outlook, consider which college may
				best help you arrive at those goals. Will you have a loan trouble at one school but not at another? Tuition costs vary by college. U.S.
				News data for the 2019-2020 school year indicates that ranked in-state public colleges will in general have the most minimal sticker 
				prices at an average of $10,116 compared with $36,801 at private schools. But, note the keywords "sticker price." While private colleges 
				will in general come with higher price tag, there may also be more institutional aid, which means students and their families may not pay
				the full tuition cost.</p>
				
				<h2>Delve into departments.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic6.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">College rankings can be one tool in the decision process, but remember that academic prestige can be examine on a smaller scale, as
				well. Research the departments you'd studying in, Roth says. Is it accurate to say that one is school better known for your major? Are 
				faculty actively engaged at school and in the field? Visit college websites and reach out faculty for more information. U.S. News also 
				ranks specific student programs in business and engineering.</p>
				
				<h2>Investigate job connections.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic7.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">One reason you attend a college is to set yourself up for a job, so consider each school's career center. Roth suggests that student 
				ask question about job fairs, on-campus interview opportunities and even the counselor-to-student ratio. Ensure that the resources are 
				sufficient to give you the help you needed. Career centers offer a variety of services, helping students with developing soft skills, 
				providing employment and salary information, promoting internship leads, conducting mock interviews, explaining hiring processes and some
				more.</p>
				
				<h2>Compare financial aid awards.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic8.jpg	" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">If you're looking to graduate from school with little next to zero debt, carefully compare financial aid packages. It's wise to look 
				beyond the tuition and see what other different charges apply. Also, understand the difference between free money – such as grants and 
				scholarships – and loans, which you'll need to repay in the long run. some colleges offer generous financial aid packages meeting full 
				financial need, which means those students are not required to take out loans.</p>
				
				<h2>Compromise.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic9.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">"The admission process can make your mother or father go somewhat wacky on occasion," write Barnard and Clark in "The Truth about 
				College Admission." The creators encourage families to accept the admission experience as an opportunity to grow and learn together, 
				taking time to encourage, support, trust and lift each other up. They emphasize that families should focus on the things they can handle 
				instead of what happens "behind close doors in college admission offices many miles away."</p>
				
				<h2>Move on from rejection.</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Steps in choosing the right college for you_pic10.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Finding out you weren't accepted to a top-choice college can be tough, Roth acknowledges, however do whatever it takes not to dwell on 
				the rejection.  An even worse result would be to let disappointment stymie the decision you still have to make. some schools are highly 
				selective, with acceptance rates in the single digits. However, at most colleges, the general odds of admission are good. The national 
				average acceptance rate at four-year institution for first-time freshman applicants was 66.7% in fall 2017, as indicated by a report from
				the National Association for College Admission Counseling.</p>
