    			<h1>How to Prepare for Quizzes and Exams</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
				
				<h2>Quiz and Exam Tips</h2>
				
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">The following are proven procedures that have helped numerous students with 
				improving grades and plan all the more adequately for quizzes and exams</p>
				
				<h2>Don't Procrastinate. Don't Cram.</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears as though some thrive on last-minute 'cramming'. Yet, most experts will concur,
				cramming isn't effective. The most concerning issue with cramming, as indicated by UCLA educator of psychiatry Andrew 
				Fuligni, is that cramming makes students sacrifice sleep time in order to study. While it's unrealistic to perform well 
				on a test without the necessary knowledge, sleep is critical for scholastic achievement. Sacrificing sleep for 
				an extra 3 or 4 hours of study is frequentlycounterproductive.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Quite possibly the most important test preparation tips we can give you is to give 
				yourself sufficient time to study. Try not to procrastinate! It's ideal to start getting ready well before the day of a 
				test. Make it a habit to  complete reading assignments on time and frequently review lecture notes. In case you're getting 
				ready for midterm or final exams,you'll need to put organize your time so you can dedicate more time to those exams that 
				are more important or will be really demanding.</p>
				
				<h2>Plan Your Study Time</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Make time for studying. Setting aside regular time to read and study is critical for 
				achieving high exam/quiz results. We suggest setting up a term calendar, week after week timetable and every day plan that
				includes regular study sessions. It's so easy for work and other activities to quickly take precedence over studying, so 
				plan your study time ahead of time. As you progress through the term it's OK to change your study timetable to address
				your needs, yet ensure you plan study sessions ahead of time – and that you stick with them.</p>
				
				<h2>Watch for Clues</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost every teacher has a methodology in making test questions – and they will in general
				utilize a similar methodology each time they prepare a test. Watch for clues your instructor may give about possible test 
				questions and formats. It is advisable to partake at test review sessions and ask questions about unclear ideas. Never be
				ashamed to ask questions.</p>
				
				<h2>Ask Your Teacher for Direction</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">We'd even suggest asking your teacher directly the most ideal approach to study for the 
				test. Many teachers are open to sharing with students suggestions, even secrets, with regards to how best plan for their
				exams. Try not to be frightened to get some information about what subjects or topics you will be tested on during the 
				exam – even what sorts of questions tomight see.</p>
				
				<h2>Arrive Early on Test Day</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you can gather before a test the better you'll be. I actually recall showing up
				for class early on the day of my AP History exam in high school. My teacher, Mr. Farr, was responding to a question asked 
				to him by another student looking for some explanation on test subject matter. Regardless of whether attentively or
				accidentally I'll never know however he said to this student, "Don't stress about that. Very little of the test covers 
				that material." Knowing that permitted me to focus my remaining 30 minutes of study on subject that would have been bound
				to be on the test.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">It's also common for students struggling with difficult concepts or subject matter to show 
				up early on test day to seek additional clarification or understanding from the teacher or instructor. This is an 
				excellent opportunity to gain additional understanding and test preparation.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure to show up to class early on exam day, in case the teacher provides any 
				additional tips, instruction or insight.</p>
				
				<h2>Review Early. Review With a Group.</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Start a final review of all lecture notes, reading assignments, and other class materials
				that will help you be prepared, several days prior to the test. You can do this review by yourself or as a part of a study
				group. Working as part of a study group is an excellent method to review in preparation for a test. Reviewing in 
				preparation for a test as part of a study group will allow you to improve your notes, fill in any holes in your 
				understanding, more fully explore complex concepts, maximize your time, cover more material, gain additional knowledge 
				about what might be on the test, and provide you with a support system.</p>
				
				<h2>Prepare an Outline</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Prepare an outline of the main topics and concepts that will be covered during a test, at
				that point utilize this sheet to study. This will assist you with memorizing key facts and other information you will be 
				tested on.</p>
				
				<h2>Use Visual Aids</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual aids, including charts, diagrams and graphs are great study helps – especially if
				you're a visual learner. Organizing information into diagrams and charts helps to condense and simplify information and 
				improves recall at test time.</p>
				
				<h2>Stay Healthy</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting plenty of rest and exercising regularly will upgrade your capacity to perform well
				on a test. Eat a nutritious foods before taking an exam to be ready and focused. Avoid junk food. Eating lousy junk food 
				or sugar before a test will cause your energy levels to drain rapidly and can affect your ability to focus.</p>
				
				
				<h2>Get Plenty of Sleep</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">It is unwise to remain up throughout the late evening studying before test day. Get plenty
				of sleep the night prior to a test. Although spending extra time preparing seems like it will improve your score, you 
				never want to show up to a test tired. Studies show that students who spend more time studying and less time cramming the 
				prior night normally perform better on tests.</p>
