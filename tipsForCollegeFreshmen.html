    			<h1>10 Tips for Incoming College Freshmen</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p>Hey there freshie, here are some tips I compiled to help you make it through your first year of college. Don’t be afraid to embark on your journey as a college student. It might be intimidating at first but here are some tips
    			</p>
                <img src="IMAGES/college student.jpg" style=" margin-left: 200px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">

                <p> <b>  Always go to class. </b> It may be tempting to skip classes where sometimes the professor gives a lax schedule but unless stated otherwise, always attend them! Who knows, maybe the prof may give instructions for future exams. You wouldn’t want to miss a thing.</p>
                <p> <b> Remember classes are your priority. </b> First and foremost, college is about academics. I know college opens up so many avenues for opportunities for you to explore, you may be living in a different city for the first time, going to “crazy college parties”, but always remember to make your classes a priority. You have all the time in the world to explore these things so it’s best to ace your academics at this point of your life and other opportunities will follow.</p>
                <p> <b> Don’t turn in work late. </b> Diligence and dependability matter in the real world. They say college is training grounds for when you venture out to the real world. It’s best to start working on this trait which will really come in handy in the future. (Exceptions may be made for emergency situations of course)</p>
                <img src="IMAGES/active student.jpg" style=" margin-left: 260px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <p> <b> Study, study, study. </b> Study as if your life depends on it because in some ways, it really does. Read up on your lecture notes, create your own reviewers, and thoroughly understand these concepts and go ace those tests!</p>
                <p> <b> Put the phone down. </b> Give your professor your 100% attention to the class. Everyone has become addicted to their phones these days and it’s a problem, but its best for everyone if you don’t have your phone out during class. It’d be respectful to your professor plus you’d understand the lesson at hand for the day and help you focus more. Place it in your pocket or inside your bag, maybe even keep it out of your reach and out of sight to lessen the temptation and distraction.</p>
                <p> <b> Go old school. </b> It’s a known fact that writing things down help you retain information so grab that notebook and pen and start scribbling. Taking down notes during a class will help you learn the material better. You can always go back and transcribe these notes into files unto your computer later.</p>
                <p> <b> Engage with the class. </b> Make the most out of your education. Don’t hesitate to speak up in class, ask questions to your professor, raise your hand for clarifications and occasionally recite as well. You paid for your education so it’s up to you to make the most out of it for your learning.</p>
                <img src="IMAGES/prof.jpg" style=" margin-left: 200px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <p> <b> Don’t be intimidated by your professors. </b> Your professors are there to help you and not just help you learn. Ask your professor when they’re free to meet with you to help accommodate you. They can help you go over your work in the class, answer questions about graduate school, discuss career paths, and many more. Take advantage of office hours. Students who do so put themselves on paths to success.</p>
                <p> <b> Participate in extra-curricular activity. </b> Branch out and interact with the rest of the campus. Immerse yourself in the activities the school has to offer and partake in organizations you’re interested in. It’s important to have some sort of balance and have fun while you’re in college and one way of doing that is taking up extra-curricular activities. Some universities even offer scholarships for these so go ahead and try to grab one.</p>
                <p> <b> Stay healthy. </b> Your body is the temple of your mind and your soul. Eat healthy, stay hydrated, and try to stay away from too much processed food. Your health is the foundation of everything else and will affect everything you do. Aim to become healthy and try to have some exercise in for a healthy mind and body so don’t ever neglect your health!</p>
