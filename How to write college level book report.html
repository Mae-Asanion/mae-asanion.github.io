    			<h1>How to Write College Level Book Report</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p style="text-align: justify">There's nothing very like enjoying a really solid piece of literature. Hours can pass while you're jumping into another world that the
				author has created. Your enjoyment of your novel may dissipate slightly when you are attempting to figure out some way how to write a
				college level book report about it—but it doesn't need to be that way. Analyzing (and perhaps critiquing) novels is a useful skill that
				will help you both in and outside of the classroom. In this post we will outline the best strategies of painless writing a book report.
				It's important to take note that there is nothing generic book report assignment. This isn't really a step-by-step guide, but it can help
				you started thinking about the particular requirements that your instructor has for you.</p>
				
				<h2>Know the assignment</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">When you star your book report assignment, it's important that you know precisely the things your instructor is requiring. Does your 
				instructor need you to explore the book's theme and write a five-paragraph essay on it, or would you supposed to be writing an essay about 
				a specific character? Read the assignment sheet carefully and make sure that you understand the entirety of the instructions. If you have 
				questions or are uncertain about something, make sure to clarify it to your instructor.</p>
			
				<h2>Actually read the book</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Despite the fact that it might be very tempting to take a shortcut and watch a movie adaptation of your book or even to read the 
				Sparknotes, definitely resist that urge. Not only will your report be more thorough if you read the book the whole way through, however 
				reading and understanding themes and outlining a novel plot is an important experience. You'll be able to to understand the books on a 
				totally new and more appreciative level. When you are reading the novel for your book report, write down page numbers or passages that 
				pertain to the assignment or that you think may be interesting to mention.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Try to really sink into what the author is trying to say by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>What is the main theme of the book?</b> The theme is the meaning or the whole reason for writing the book. An author doesn't typically
					write just to write something. What motivated them to pen this novel?</li>
					
					<li><b>What is happening to the characters?</b> Normally books are told from the perspective (either in the first or third 
					person) of the main character, however some books have various perspective. Is this character a good character or would 
					they say they are flawed? What sorts of obstacles is the character going through? What did they learn throughout the 
					story?</li>
					
					<li><b>What is the plot of the book?</b> There are a several various types of plots, and it's helpful to understand what 
					kind your chosen novel has to help you with analyze it better. Some stories are quests: that is, the main character is on
					journey to achieve a goal (think Lord about the Rings). Some stories are overcoming obstacles-whether that is internal or
					external. What sort of plot does your novel have and for what reason do you think the creator picked that specific 
					type?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Write a good introduction</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">After you've read your book completely and you've thought about the characters, themes, plot, and some good quotes, you'll 
				be ready to start writing the book report. Like some other paper, a good book report needs an explanatory introduction that is
				simple and easy to understand. When writing the introduction, make sure to include the title of the work, the author, and a 
				sentence or two on the thing you will be overviewing in the report. Despite the fact that it may not be needed to have a 
				thesis statement in your book report, writing one in your paper may keep it more focused and help you narrow down the thing 
				you will be writing in the body paragraphs.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">For example, if we were writing an introduction about a book report over Harper Lee's <b>To Kill a Mockingbird</b>, we 
				might write something like this:</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">In Harper Lee's iconic coming of age novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, Lee confronts the audience with the possibility that 
				systematic racism was widespread in the U.S. court system in the early 20th century in the South. She illustrates this idea 
				with the unfair trial of convicted rapist Tom Robinson, whose attorney Atticus Finch helpfully proves is innocent, yet is 
				still sentenced with a a crime he didn't commit. Through the eyes of the young main character, Scout Finch, the audience is 
				able to find out about these injustice with the innocent eyes of a child.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">As you can see, we mentioned the name of the book, the author, and we also laid out the thing we would discussing all 
				through the body paragraphs in the book report. Not only will this let the reader understand what is this report about, but 
				it'll also help you stay organized when you are writing the paper. Note that nowhere in this paragraph does it say that we 
				truly like or loved the book. Regardless of whether we liked the book is irrelevant in the report. What the book report is 
				trying to do is to objectively understand a book's relevance and importance wit themes, characters, motifs, and so on 
				(Despite the fact that obviously it's totally perfectly okay and encourage to like the book that you are reviewing.)</p>
				
				<h2>Implement the ideas in the body paragraphs</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">The meat of your book report will be in the body sections. These sections will develop the thoughts that you raised in your
				introduction paragraph and allow you to introduce the novel in depth with your reader.</p>
				
				<h3 style="font-size: 28px;">Summary</h3>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Though no two book report assignments are the very same, it's likely your instructor will need to see some summarization in
				your book report. Your summary of the novel shouldn't be excessively long (this is a report after all, so it's normally quite 
				short). If your instructor has assigned a five-page book report, don't sum up the book in four and a half pages. As a general
				rule, submit around 1/3 of the paper to a summary just to make sure the reader understands your analysis of it without having 
				to read it.</p>
				
				<h3 style="font-size: 28px;">Analysis</h3>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Once you are done writing the summary of the novel, then at that point you can get into your actual analysis of it. You may 
				remember that we brought up systemic racism in the U.S. court system in the South in our essay on To Kill a Mockingbird. In our
				summary, we would then explore those ideas that we delivered to the reader. How does Lee show this idea all throughout the 
				novel? A good way to show how the author is making this point is through direct quotations from the book that you believe are
				a good showcase.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">In your analysis, you should also be discussing theme (or what was the author's purpose behind writing this book) and 
				character. No two analysis are something similar, which is the thing that makes book reports criticism so interesting.
				Everybody will read the novel through their very own personal lenses and experience and come up with a totally completely 
				different interpretation of what the author intended for us to come away with.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Again, it's crucial to continue to take a look at your instructions for your book report so you know precisely what you 
				should discussing. Regardless of whether you write a brilliant report over the theme of systematic racism in the court system 
				in To Kill a Mockingbird, it will not benefit you in any way when you were really supposed to write on the relation among 
				Scout and Atticus Finch and why it mattered. Focusing on instruction is probably the biggest keys to success writing a book
				report.</p>
				
				<h3 style="font-size: 28px;">Conclusion</h3>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">As with all other conclusions, focus around wrapping things up neatly. In spite of the fact that you might be tempted to 
				simply say in the conclusion that you either loved or hated the book, this doesn't make for a interesting paragraph. When you 
				are writing your conclusion on your book report, consider why this novel matters. If you didn't like it, think why you didn't
				like it. Think how well the author gets himself or herself clear. Should this book be read widely to acquire a critical 
				understanding of a subject? Why or why not? Would you recommend this book to other people? The genre of book reports by and
				large searches out the opinion of the author, so ensure that you let your voice be heard.</p>
				
				<h3 style="font-size: 28px;">Revising</h3>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Like any other paper that you write, it's critical to go back and revise if you are turning in the last copy. It's 
				extremely rare that you'll write something that doesn't have any mistakes or reworking to do. Once you have written the first 
				draft, take a short break to get your eyes off the paper for only a bit. Return to the paper after the break with a set of 
				fresh eyes and try to read through it for grammar and spelling mistakes (spell check doesn't get everything!) and then once 
				again for content. Ensure that all that everything make sense and is very explanatory. After all—you need to assume that your 
				audience has not ye read your book so you need to make sure that you are explaining it all well enough to someone who has 
				never read a sentence of it and still able to understand.</p>
				
				<h2>Book reports teach us more than just how to write a report</h2>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Though we do a lot of research and studying about subjects that may not be applicable after college, book reports might be 
				one of the only exceptions for that. Novels, regardless of how abstract the concept, show us about human behavior and life 
				through plots and characters. Seeing how to separate an author's intent to their stories will totally be relevant to your 
				life. Having the curiosity and the abilities to understand a novel with a more complex understanding will without a doubt 
				enrich your reading experience.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">Remember that an effective book report will have an introduction that specifies the book title, writer, and include the 
				points you will make all throughout the body paragraphs. Your body paragraphs will develop those thoughts that you raised in 
				the introduction, using quotes from the book, analysis, and summary to aide you.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify">At last, be certain that once the book report has been written that you are carefully taking a look at spelling, grammar, 
				and the content of your paragraphs. Get a friend, your instructor, or even a professional editor to take a look at your book 
				report to ensure you are on the right track.</p>
