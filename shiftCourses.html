    			<h1>How do you know if you should shift courses?</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<ul type="circle">
                    <li><b>When you envision yourself in this field you’re taking after graduation, how does it make you feel?</b> If anything you should at least have an inkling that the field or industry you are entering is one that you can reasonably see yourself in. There’s no pressure to find what kind of job you’re going to have in the future the minute you become a freshman though. You can take as much time as you want to figure that out.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Are those negative feelings about your course consistent or temporary?</b> The thoughts that have made you think about shifting to another course could stem from the fact that this wasn’t meant for you and you know it, but it could also be because you are going through a rough patch in school. Take the time to determine what your true feelings about your course is before making any major decisions.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Will switching from your current discipline to another one make everything better?</b> You have to take into account a lot of things when switching to another course. What you choose to study has a direct impact on what kind of job you can get in the future. Does your passion and skill to the course that you want to shift to, allow you to have a stable future? Or, will it be more worth it to stay where you are right now?</li><br>
                    <li><b>Does your prospect course align with your strengths and who you want to become in life?</b> Since shifting your course is a big decision, you also have to be very sure about it. You have to make sure that the skills that you have and what you want to be in the future aligns with what you have chosen.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Are you ready for the consequences that changing courses may bring?</b> Your schedule will become a lot more hectic as a result of shifting. If you had done it in the beginning of the semester of your first year, you might not have to face that, but that is not the case for most others. You will have to make up for lost units that you didn’t take before, and your schedule might be busier than your peers’ as a result of that.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Create a balance</b> - Try to have a balanced schedule between your work and time as a student and your free time where you can take care of yourself and do whatever you want to do for leisure.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Is this the course that you want to take up in the first place?</b> Lastly, you have to be sure that this is what you want in the first place. Passion will get you further than you think, it’s a propeller, not a crutch. Sometimes, passion doesn’t have to play as much of a factor though. In that sense, you either need to evaluate how passionate you are about the topic, or how stable you might be in the future, after you enter the field your course is based on.</li>
