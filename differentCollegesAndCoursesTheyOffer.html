				<h1>Different Colleges and courses they offer</h1>
				<hr><br><br>
				<img src="IMAGES/different colleges.jpg" class="center" style="height:450px; width: 500px;"><br>
   
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">Core undergraduate classes, which can be extremely helpful to your future or simply a series of generic lectures that you will find ineffective, will be required of you by your college. Despite the above, you should not be discouraged from enrolling in non-degree-related courses.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">In reality, having a basic understanding of certain subjects can be extremely useful throughout one's life, and it is in one's best interests to learn at least basic skills. These will be useful in your education, work, and personal life. Although it may not be possible to enroll in all of the courses listed below, it is possible to see how students might gain from the information presented in each. Some are part of an undergraduate's core curriculum, although this varies depending on the institution.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Consider which classes will benefit you the most and which will count against your graduation requirements before enrolling in any. You may ask, "Does the school offer credit for this course?" You don't want to squander your college years because a college diploma isn't cheap.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a list of college courses that you should consider taking, regardless of your expected or current major, to build a strong academic base. These college courses will provide you with the comprehensive skills you'll need to succeed later in life! Some may argue that the following courses are among the best college courses available:</p>

				<p><b>Accounting/Finance</b></p>
				<p>Most people despise the mere suggestion, but having a job implies that you want to earn money. Furthermore, if you want to make money, you would be required to pay taxes. You'll be a lot more self-sufficient than most of your peers if you can file your own taxes and handle your income.</p></li>
			
				<p><b>Art/Design</b></p>
				<p>Maybe you aren't the most outwardly artistic person on the planet. However, this does not exclude you from appreciating and cultivating an appreciation for the arts. It also shouldn't stop you from channeling your inner Picasso. Nobody has a one-dimensional skill set, and college is all about discovery.</p></li>
				
			
				<p><b>Business/Business Management</b></p>
				<p>If you want to start your own company, work for a large corporation, or work in a small office, business is present in every workplace. Even if you aren't in charge of the company, knowing how things work and what your bosses or supervisors are going through, as well as how companies function and how critical business decisions are made, is beneficial. Not to mention, if your superior ever asks your opinion on a business matter, you should be able to answer intelligently.</p></li>
				
		
				<p><b>Communication/Speech</b></p>
				<p>It's very critical to learn how to clearly express your message, whether you're speaking to one person or a hundred. You'll learn how to communicate effectively by knowing your audience, conveying your message, and communicating with trust in these courses.</p></li>
				
				
				<p><b>History</b></p>
				<p>Knowing these past events will help future discoveries because our history has such a strong influence on our future. While there is much too much history to learn in a single course, focusing on one topic that interests you is a great place to begin.</p></li>
				

				<p><b>Journalism/Writing</b></p>
				<p>Strong writing skills would be helpful, if not necessary, to your success in whatever area you want to pursue. They'll assist you in communicating with potential employers as well as your supervisor and coworkers once you've been hired. Writing skills will become increasingly important in your life. Writing is a skill that will never go out of style. </p></li>
				
		
				<p><b>Physical Education</b></p>
				<p>As an elective, any course that keeps you interested is always a good choice. You could discover new interests you didn't know you had if you take a mindfulness or Art of Walking course.</p></li>
				
			
				<p><b>Political Science</b></p>
				<p>Within these courses, you can learn about how elections really work, how the government is structured and, of course, politics galore.</p></li>
				
				
				<p><b>Sciences</b></p>
				<p>Science is all around us. Learning about scientific subjects will further your discovery about the world in which you live. You can choose from such an array of topics pick one that interests you and explore.</p></li>
				
				
				<p><b>Statistics</b></p>
				<p>Involved in so many of our business and financial decisions, statistics often seem to make the world go round. A basic understanding of how statistics are calculated is integral to making the very decisions based on them. </p></li>
				
		
				<p><b>Computer Science/Web Design/Development</b></p>
				<p>It’s no secret that basic computer skills are now a must within pretty much every career. Give it a few more years and you can likely add basic HTML coding and editing webpages to that requirement as well. If you can add other web development skills to your repertoire like proficiency in programs, such as Photoshop, Python, and JavaScript then you’re going to be way ahead of the curve. Also consider enhancing your knowledge in Cybersecurity. Having web security understanding will serve you and your future company well.</p></li>
