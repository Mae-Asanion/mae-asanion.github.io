    			<h1>10 Reasons why your scholarship application will fail</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<ol>
				<li type="1"><b>You don’t qualify for the scholarship</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's start with some achievable goals. Every scholarship and there are a lot of them, has its own set of criteria. So, if they need a straight-A student and you consistently receive Cs, don't bother applying. If you are from Singapore and the scholarship is for Nigerian people.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You forgot to research all the options</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">A successful scholarship application takes time to plan, and the first stage is studied. You must be aware of all of your choices and obtain as much knowledge as possible about the requirements of each scholarship. Almost every university and college has a scholarship or bursary program, which is normally merit-based and fiercely competitive.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You only applied for one or two scholarships</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Fill out as many applications as you are qualified for. This increases the chances of success. Yes, it takes time because you must tailor each application to that particular scholarship, but you want the money, right?</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You left it until the last minute</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">You'll need time to organize yourself in addition to conducting research. Find some qualified referees and explain what you want them to do and say. Make arrangements for any necessary documents, such as transcripts, which may include certification. It's pointless to submit the application unless it's fully filled out, so don't take the chance of missing anything crucial.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You missed the deadline</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly, this is a normal occurrence. Each scholarship has a different deadline, so don't think they'll all be accepted at the same time. It's done until the deadline has passed. It also reflects poorly on your management skills if you send it late.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You didn’t answer the question</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The questions were created by the scholarship committee to determine if you possess the skills they need. So don't respond to a question about how you overcome a challenge by bragging about your stellar high school grades. If you don't follow the instructions or answer the questions completely, the committee will presume you've copied and pasted the same applies to any scholarship.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You fell for a scholarship scam</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">You didn't earn the scholarship because it didn't exist in the first place. Be wary of websites that promise guaranteed scholarships for a small fee, or organizations that ask for your bank account details or money upfront. There should never be a fee associated with applying for a scholarship. As a result, don't do it.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You lost your audience on the first page</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't presume your reader can understand every technical detail of your proposed Ph.D. if you're applying for a post-graduate or research grant. If you're able to explain jargon and acronyms, stay away from them. Consider this: Will my mother be able to comprehend it? Also, if you're unsure, have her read it first.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You forgot to check your grammar</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, the pronunciation. If your application contains even one spelling error, it will be rejected by certain committees. It must be flawless, and it must also show your language proficiency.</p></li>
				
				<li type="1"><b>You didn’t get it proof-read</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Check it over with some friends and family for spelling errors, structure, and whether the questions are answered. It's also a good idea to demonstrate it to the referees because they know what skills to highlight if they're asked for a recommendation.</p></li>
