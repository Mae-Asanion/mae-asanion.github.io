    			<h1>One of the Most Stressful Times in my Life: </h1><h3 class="subtitle"> Experience during College Entrance Exams </h3>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p>That time between graduating high school and looking for universities to attend for college has probably been one of the worst time of my life. It was dreadful. Would I be able to go to college? Which university would I attend? Am I going to be accepted anywhere? Is my family going to be able to pay for this? </p>
                <p>I took exams from five different schools and one of these schools was unplanned. Our aim was for me to get accepted at the University of the Philippines, if not, then a state university. But my, oh my, my mother had such expectations for me. She actually believed I could get into U.P. I thought I did my best but that examination was the longest four hours of my life. I was so drained by the end of the day and out of over 100,000 applicants all over the country, only the best of the best got in. I remember receiving my result and it didn’t even reach the line of 1.00. It was tough and I cried and apologized to my mom because I felt like I let her down. Who wouldn’t not want to get into the best school in the Philippines, right? </p> 
                <p>I wish I’ve known earlier not to be too hard on myself because when one door closes, another one opens and so we moved onto our other options. At least I know which school not to attend to now, right? </p>
                <p>The other school was applied to, was the University of Santo Tomas. My math grades were horrible, which was no surprise. I was never the best at math and I only did enough to pass and not fail the subject. But taking the math examination portion in every college entrance exam was something I extremely dreaded. Which is why I always do my best and play to my other strengths which were English and (some) Science. More specifically geometry and the biology portion. I surprisingly passed the exam for this university. My math wasn’t the highest but my other subjects pulled me through enough to pass the entrance exam. But alas, that school was too prestigious and expensive and one we could not afford so we had to let that go.</p>
                <p>The next school I applied to was the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. A state university and one of our back up. Just like my experience with UST, my math grade was once again average and saved by other subjects. I passed the exam, BUT, I did not qualify for the required grade quota to be able to take up the Information Technology course. I believe the required grade to be able to get into that program was something along the lines of a 90% and I only got the range of 85-90%. All I remember was I still had the option to go to this school, but I just have to take up another program. At least I passed two exams now, right? We set that aside and waited for results from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM), which was one of the other schools I applied to. It was such a shame too since my aunt graduated from here so PUP offered a nice IT curriculum and part of me was hoping I’d attend this school.</p>
                <p> I applied to another state university because we weren’t really in a luxurious space where I could attend any university and pick up any course I wanted. I remember the exam here was as difficult as taking the UP exam… maybe even harder. This one may not have taken four hours, but the content for the math and science exam were challenging. This school was known for engineering courses and I was a little intimidated by it. I got my result, but I failed. I actually wrote an appeal for this university in the hopes of getting in since my family really needed it since I had a single parent mother and another sibling. I did the paperwork for the appeal and waited for the news. </p>
                <p>It was nearing the going back to school season. Some universities were starting in June, and some in August. My peers from my old school were already getting picked and sharing their acceptance letters whereas I was still in the process of picking a school to attend to.</p>
                <p>One last school I applied to, was the University of the East. This school was entirely unplanned and out of our initial list. At the time, my options at the time were taking up a different course in PUP and waiting for the approval of my appeal to get into PLM. So of course, I had to try. This school was still a little pricey but it seemed manageable to pay for. I tried the exam and immediately got the result and I was really glad to find out that I passed.</p>
                <p>I ended up going to the University of the East because I missed the deadline for PUP. School was starting soon and this was one of my last options. We went ahead and enrolled in UE and then I found out a week later that my appeal for PLM was approved. I still had the chance to pull out of UE since I didn’t pay the full tuition and go to PLM, however, I no longer had it in me to transfer schools and adjusting all over again. I made a truce with my mom that I’d try to get accepted into the scholarship programs available so it’d be a big help for us and I’d still be able to attend this school.</p> 
                <p>I got very scared of where I’d end up. I don’t think of myself as a smart student. I get good grades for sure, but it’s only because I am very hardworking and responsible. I pass requirements on time and I always make sure I never fail anything as much as possible. </p>
                <p>I took up 5 exams in and passed in 3 of them. I missed the day for enrollment for one of them and the other one was very expensive and I only tried there to test my luck. </p>
                <p>Attending the University of the East was not part of our plan but here I am now, in 2nd year of college. I think I’m doing okay and hopefully I would be able to graduate. What I learned from this very stressful point of my life is that it is okay if things did not go as planned. As they said when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. One shouldn’t get discouraged if they didn’t get into the school you want because there are other options and opportunities to go to. When one door closes, another one opens!</p>
