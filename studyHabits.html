    			<h1>Healthy Study Habits</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
                <p> Did you know that having healthy study habits can lead to having a healthy mind and body and a happy life? I know being a student is tough and can take a lot out of us, but it's still important to take care of our health, so here are some healthy study habits every student should know! </p>
                 <img src="IMAGES/healthy study habits.jpg" style=" margin-left: 300px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
    			<p><b> CRAMMING IS NOT THE ANSWER</b> </p>
                <p> Successful students typically pace out their studying in shorter periods of time and rarely try to cram all of their studying into just one or two sessions. Being consistent is more efficient when it comes to studying and it pays to have regular, yet shorter, study periods. That way you have enough rest and you won’t find yourself staying up late at night anymore and gone are the battles for trying to keep your eyelids open late at night when studying!</p>
                <p> <b>PLAN WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO STUDY.</b> </p>
                <p>     A good student schedules specific times throughout their week when they are going to study and stick to their schedule. Dedicating a study time in your weekly routine to review your courses will ensure you develop habits that will enable you to succeed in your education.</p>

                <p><b>EACH STUDY TIME SHOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC GOAL. </b> </p>
                <p>It’s not enough that you make it a habit to set aside time to study, but its also just as important to know what you need to accomplish during each study session. Studying without direction would not be effective so be sure to have a goal in mind to know which to focus on before starting.</p>
                <p> <b> NEVER PROCRASTINATE YOUR PLANNED STUDY SESSION. </b> </p>
                <p>There may be many reasons that’ll prompt you to procrastinate- whether it be because you don’t like the subject or there are other things you have to do, or simply because the assignment is difficult- no matter the reason although it may be very tempting, under no circumstances procrastinate on studying. If you want to be a successful student, then do not procrastinate. It will most likely become much less effective and you may not get everything accomplished on time if you do so. </p>
                <img src="IMAGES/hard assignment.jpeg" style=" margin-left: 300px;height: 250px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px grey; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <p> <b>START WITH THE MOST DIFFICULT SUBJECT FIRST.</b></p>
                <p>The most difficult subject will require more of your time, effort, and mental health energy so it is best to do the most difficult subject first and get it over with so you will be able to complete the rest of your work with ease. Starting with the most challenging one can boost your motivation and improve effectiveness when it comes to your study session and your academic performance.</p>
                <p><b>ALWAYS REVIEW YOUR NOTES BEFORE STARTING AN ASSIGNMENT.</b></p>
                <p>You can’t review your notes if you don’t have those in the first place so be sure to take good notes in class. Going through your notes before starting an assignment or a study session will help you accomplish the assignment correctly and will help you remember important subject matter learned during the day. </p>
                <p> <b>MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT DISTRACTED WHILE YOU'RE STUDYING.</b></p>
                <p>When you’re prone to distractions, it will affect your focus and your productivity so before you start studying, it is best to find a place where you won’t be disturbed or distracted for continuous productivity!</p>
                <p><b>USE STUDY GROUPS EFFECTIVELY.</b> </p>
                <p>Only work in study groups when everyone is prepared and already knows the material. That way you can all teach and test each other more effectively and lessen the possibility of just hanging out and interacting with your friends. After all two heads are better than one. You can get help from others when you’re struggling to understand a concept, complete assignments more quickly, and teach others and effectively help you understand the material even better along the process.</p>
