    			<h1>Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
				
    			<p style="text-align:justify">Most college students focus around three things: classes, studying, and socializing (and presumably not in a specific 
				order). With all that is going on around campus grounds, it's safe to say most students don't spend plenty of time thinking 
				about living green.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">But, there are a couple of easy ways any college students can be more eco-friendly without having to make major changes to 
				their ways of life. As a student, being eco-friendly aides your carbon footprint, but additionally your wallet – most 
				eco-friendly practices likewise double as money saving practices, which comes in very handy when you're on a student's
				budget.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">So take a read through the following tips and make your time at college as practical as could be expected. You may simply
				save a couple of money along the way, as well.</p>
				
				<h2>Recycle!</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic1.webp" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Consider how much paper you use during the semester – your class notes, assignments, tests papers, research every one of 
				the papers you're gathered. What's more, think about all the plastic food and drink containers you're probably going to go 
				through in a year. By and large, it's most likely enough to occupy your apartment twice over.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Rather than letting those recyclables end up in the landfill, follow these simple tips to ensure all that can be recycle 
				is disposed appropriately.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Living on campus:</b> most college schools have recycle bins spread around the campus, so find the closest one to you and 
				regularly visit the bin and recycle your stacks of paper. if you don't have the access to approach a recycle bin, contact your
				administration and find out where the closest drop-off is – and urge them to install more blue bins around campus grounds 
				while you're at it.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Living off campus grounds:</b> Most communities requires you to separate your trash, so take a plastic bag, add your papers, 
				and put it either by the curb for pick up or in your apartment building's trash can. You can likewise separate and recycle 
				your cans, bottles, cardboard boxes and food scraps. Depending upon your state or province, you may also have the option to
				return your cans and bottles for cash.</p>
				
				<h2>Walk, bike or take public transit when possible</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic2.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">It's common knowledge that the less vehicles out on the road, the less pollution in the air. Cars and motorcycles are 
				essential, no doubt, but use them just when necessary not only save money on gas as well as saves wear and tear on the 
				machine. Ask yourself, do you truly need a vehicle?</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Many Students thought they need a car at college, however the truth is most campus grounds are pedestrian friendly, and 
				most of the time your car will sit in the student parking lot accumulating parking fees and monthly insurance premiums. Sell
				the car, and instead invest into a bike or transit pass (if one is excluded from your tuition), depending upon your particular
				needs.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">With regards to picking a bicycle, purchase a good quality used item on Craigslist to save money and reduce your footprint.
				For break, ride public transport or carpool with a fellow student. Many college universities have carpool boards to pair 
				riders with drivers – be certain to check for one at your school.<p>
				
				<h2>Buy green products</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic3.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Recycle products, particularly paper products, are available in many stores now, and buying these things has a major effect
				in the recycle industry. Much of the time, they don't cost anything else than traditional products either.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">In case you don't know where to begin with when it comes to purchasing green products, and there's no retailer in your area
				offering sustainable products, consider buying online. You can even get an Amazon Prime discount for students that offers free
				2-day shipping on textbooks and other merchandise.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Some other green products we recommend for every student:</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Energy efficient power bars:</b> TVs, computers, phone chargers, coffee makers and many other electrical devices still use 
				electricity when plugged in, despite the fact that they might be idle. using a power strip with an on/off switch or control 
				outlets helps simultaneously disconnect a variety of electronics. With students constantly on the go, it's an efficient way to
				limit electric usage in the dorm.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Local food:</b> Sometimes students like to prepare their own meals, but it takes a lot of resources to ship produce to stores 
				across the country. Purchasing local reduces the carbon footprint and helps support local farmers.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Thrift shopping:</b> Looking for some new furnishings or decorations for the dorm? Rather than purchasing new at a major 
				department store try out local thrift shops which have great used and interesting items. It also helps support the local 
				economy.</p>
				
				<h2>Wash cups and plates</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic4.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Washing dishes is the last thing most college students think about, however it may be perhaps the most eco-friendly things 
				you can do. In case you're moving into your first apartment, stay away from the temptation of dispensable paper or plastic 
				plates, cups and utensils. Indeed, it's very convenient, however this add amounts to the tons of waste – and money.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Get some cheap plates and utensils and see whether you can get your housemates to contribute to dish obligation, so 
				everybody shares the weight. if you're living in a dorm, wash any of the dishes in the kitchenette or in the bathroom sink.</p>
				
				<h2>Save paper</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic5.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Never buy new books except if you need to. used books will cost you less, and they don't add to new printing. Analyze the 
				expense at the campus store to online sellers for the best deal. The same applies toward the end of the class—compare the 
				repurchase amount at the campus store to what you could make selling it yourself online or to another student.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">For other paper supplies you need, just purchase the bare minimum you will really use. For specialty supplies, stand by 
				until you really need them prior to buying since class plans often change mid-term.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Paper is one of the main areas where college students can save money and the environment. The less you need to restock your 
				paper supplies, the better. Some simple tips to begin with:</p>
				
				
				<ul>
					<li>Make use the back of your paper when writing notes and</li>
					<li>Avoid taking handfuls of paper napkins from the cafeteria.</li>
					<li>When printing, save misprints, bad copies and mistakes by always double checking the document you’re printing.</li>
					<li>If you do make a mistake, either recycle the paper or cut the paper in half and use the back for scrap paper for notes,
					writing down ideas for papers, e</li>
					<li>For those who write notes on paper, refillable binders save more paper than notebooks.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Purchase a reusable water bottle – and take it everywhere!</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic6.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">There are so many flavored health drinks and designer water on the shelves that it's tempting to believe they are essential.
				As a matter of fact, clean water is the thing that is essential forever, and it is typically available from the tap.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Drinking bottled water creates a lot of trash that can potentially end up in the landfill. Use a reusable water bottle and
				fill it day by day either at home or from the water fountains on the campus. You'll save money by not needing to purchase 
				bottled drinks on the get go, and you'll save money on the amount of waste you produce.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">The same goes for disposable coffee cups – however it very well might be more convenient, those waxed paper cups aren't 
				recyclable, and will simply end up in the landfill after you're finished with them. So carry a second bottle or reusable mug
				with you for your hot drinks – you'll even get a discount on your cup of joe (at most shops) for opting out of the cup.</p>
				
				<h2>Use LED light bulbs</h2>
				
				<img class="pics" src="IMAGES/Ways To be an Eco Friendly College Student_pic7.jpg" />
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">With all the studying you'll do, you will undoubtedly wear out a light bulb or two. What's more, when you do, you should 
				decide on energy efficient LED bulbs. LED bulbs cost a bit more than incandescent and CFL bulbs, but the saving comes in the 
				electricity bill, just as the long term cost savings. LEDs last much longer than other bulbs and produce all the more light 
				for less wattage.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Lamp light is more pleasant for studying, and actually more eco-friendly. A couple of used lamps can be bought and fit with
				energy efficient LED light bulbs. The expensive overhead lights can be turned off – they're not useful for reading anyway.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify">Your time at college or university makes certain to be a memorable one – and hopefully these tips will help you reduce your
				carbon footprint, and save you a bit of money while you focus on your studies (… and socializing).</p>
