    			<h1>How to write academic and research papers better</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">Academic papers are the bane of students’ school experience. It’s technical, precise and leaves little room for errors. Despite that, there are a few ways in which you can improve the way you write yours!
    			</p>
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li><b>Thesis Statement</b> - A thesis statement is something that is crucial to any paper you write, it makes ideas and concepts easier to grasp. As it presents the main argument of your paper, a good one should be debatable, specific and concise.</li>
                    <li><b>Introductions and Conclusions</b> - Introductions are the first thing your readers see. It is what first presents your argument, and why it is worth it to continue reading. It should consist of something specific about the topic and something generic to ease them into it. Conclusions present a chance to frame your argument to its barebones to drive home the essence of what you really want to say. Your conclusion should be a broad summary of your argument that tries to arrive at the same conclusion as your reader.</li>
                    <li><b>Citation and Academic Honesty</b> - Probably the simplest to grasp concept when it comes to writing academic papers. All of the ideas and concepts that you used to make your paper that don’t directly come from your own thoughts and ideas, are not yours. As such you should provide proper citation to your paper, to give them credit. There are many different types of citation styles. Unless instructed otherwise by your superiors, use the one most familiar to you. There are also numerous applications and websites that do most of the work for you by generating them themselves.</li>
                    <li><b>Presentation and Format</b> - The presentation and formatting of your paper still has a lot of importance attached to it, in relation to your written work. A great paper would not be helped by a sloppy way of presentation. In fact, it may even hurt it. Always follow the formatting guidelines given to you by your professor, or in the event that that is not available, refer to past academic papers or the internet and make it as presentable as you can.</li>
