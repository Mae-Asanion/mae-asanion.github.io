				<h1>Where to study? Choosing a study destination</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many factors to be considered when choosing your study destination.  Picking your subject area can be relatively straight forward, consider selecting the area you are interested in, or have prior experience in.  But how do you decide where to study?</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: justify;">You should think about the following questions when deciding where to study:</p>
				
				<ul style="text-align:Justify;">
				<p>What language do you want to study in?</p>
				
				<p>What style of education are you looking for?</p>
				
				<p>How difficult will it be to get a visa?</p>
				
				<p>What are the University entry requirements?</p>
				
				<p>Which destinations are the most affordable?</p>
				
				<p>Are there opportunities for employment after study?</p>
				
				<p>Will culture shock be a problem?</p>
				</ul>				
				
				<h4>Study Language</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The teaching style you hope to receive is also an important factor in deciding where to study.  Do you prefer to be left to your own devices and learn independently?  If so a UK education may be more suitable. However, if you prefer more direction and guidance you may opt for an education in the USA. If you would like the best of both worlds Australia may be just the place.</p>
				
				<h4>Style of Education</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">There are really two parts to this. Where is the best country to specialize in this subject area? Maybe it’s a country with plenty of internship and graduate work opportunities in that industry. Or a city that has access to specific resources. If you’re interested in marine biology, why not head straight to the world’s largest coral reef in Australia and learn right at the source?</p>
				
				<h4>Student Visa</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have narrowed down your options based on the language and style of the education you want it’s important to consider the factors outside of your control. One of these factors is student visas. To put it bluntly you can’t leave home without one!</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">A student visa is mandatory for gaining entry to your chosen destination. </p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The application process can vary depending on your chosen destination, your citizenship and your intended course of study. </p>
				
				<h4>University Entry Requirements</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">The other factor outside of your control is your acceptance into your chosen university. Throughout the application process, you will encounter a lot of competition to gain entry into the prestigious institutions.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are seeking an English language education make sure you research the English language requirements. You will be expected to sit for language tests such as IELTS and TOEFL.</p>
				
				<h4>Study Costs</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">For many students the decision of where to study will simply come down to costs. An overseas education can vary greatly in cost. Not only can the cost vary between countries, but also between regions in the same country.</p>
				
				<h4>Employment opportunities</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">An overseas education can help you find postgraduate work around the world. An education from the US and the UK is highly regarded and will no doubt improve your chances of finding work.</p>
				
				<h4>Culture Shock</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Often the most overlooked factor when deciding where to study is culture shock. While culture shock should not put you off pursuing an overseas education it is important that you prepare for it, especially if your chosen destination’s culture varies greatly from your home culture.</p>
