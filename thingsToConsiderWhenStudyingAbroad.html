    			<h1>Things to consider when studying abroad</h1>
				<img src="IMAGES/abroad.jpg" class="center" style="height: 250px; width: 300px; border-radius: 10px;"><br>

    			<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most popular college bucket list items is to study abroad. If more students choose to spend a few weeks, a year, or anywhere in between exploring another part of the world, the number of choices has increased exponentially. It's nice to have options, but having too many will make the decision-making process difficult. What are your travel plans? How long will you be there? And how far would it set you back?</p>
				<h4><b>Costs</b></h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Is it anything I can afford? is one of the first questions that many students have while thinking about studying abroad. And it's not without excuse. The only thing you can do before making any real plans or commitments is to create a budget. Don't let your bank statement's number scare you into giving up your wanderlust; instead, be realistic. Studying abroad is expensive, but this can be made more manageable if you know what you're getting yourself into before you go.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the major things to include in your potential study abroad budget: </p>

				<ul>
				<li>
				<p><b>Plane tickets:</b>Since flights account for a significant portion of your budget, search for cheaper flights at odd hours of the day or week. Use Google Flights to compare airlines and flight times, and use incognito mode in your browser to avoid seeing higher rates the next time you look.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Housing:</b>You could have more options in this group depending on where you go. You may live in a dorm, with a family, with other students, or in an apartment, with a wide range of costs.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Tuition:</b>Some schools work with those in other countries to provide tuition rates that are comparable to what you will pay at home, study abroad might be included in your tuition, or you may be able to add any existing scholarships to these expenses. Check with your school's study abroad and financial aid offices to see what options are available.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Travel:</b>Will you have the opportunity to fly across the world or continent while you're away? And if you don't have firm plans right away, put some money aside if you know this is something you'll want to do.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Fun:</b>Entertainment, just like at home, will drain your bank account faster than you know. And you're less likely to rein yourself in by using your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as evidence. A little forethought would ensure that you are not broke when you return home.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Travel insurance:</b>The Loss of luggage and changes in plans can be covered by your travel insurance. When traveling abroad, it's likely that you'll have to pay extra for medical coverage. To see if it's needed, check with your school or program.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Food:</b>You'll probably eat out more in foreign countries than you do at home in order to try all the different cuisines. You won't have a meal plan if you aren't living on a college campus, so you'll have to do your own grocery shopping.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Visas and passport:</b>If you'll be attending school in another country, you'll almost certainly need a student visa, and if you'll be staying longer and working for pay, you'll need even more paperwork. And you'll need a passport no matter where you go. Make sure you apply for all of these items in advance, as processing can take weeks or months.</p></li>
				<li>
				<p><b>Scholarships:</b>Look at scholarships and other types of financial aid before you get too worked up about the cost of this training. While you may not be able to pay the entire expense, you may be eligible for scholarships that you already obtain for your education, and there are numerous scholarships available for studies abroad.</p></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Duration</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">It's time to find out what you'll be doing and how long you'll be gone now that we've gotten past the scary portion. Most people envision themselves attending classes on a foreign campus for an entire semester when they think of studying abroad, but don't worry if that's not your cup of tea! There are numerous other options to considers.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">If you're looking for something fast, many colleges offer programs in which you take a class on campus and then go on a short trip with other students and professors, usually during a scheduled break. There are also several programs where you don't take any courses and just spend a week or two learning about another community firsthand. There are several groups that plan trips exclusively for college students and young adults if you're looking for something even less academic. If you don't have a big budget or are nervous about being away from home for an extended period of time, all of these options are excellent. In the vein of more conventional study abroad, taking classes on a foreign college campus during the fall or spring semester is a tried-and-true choice. The biggest snag here is devoting an entire semester, ensuring that you graduate on time, determining which courses can move back to your home university, and/or retaining some financial assistance. Spending a summer abroad is another choice if you don't want to be away from campus during the school year.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, if a semester isn't enough time away, the gap year alternative is available for the truly adventurous. If you're about to graduate and can't fit anything else in until you leave campus, this option is ideal. It can also serve as a pleasant transition from college to the real world.</p>
				
				<h4>Type of program</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, it depends on what you want to do when traveling, you can choose from a number of programs. Wide organizations such as Education First and International Studies Abroad, for example, offer a variety of study abroad options. Although these organizations provide programs worldwide, they may not be accessible in the country or city where you choose to live. If you can't find a service you want from a larger company, don't restrict yourself. Your school's study abroad office might also be able to suggest programs.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several companies that cater directly to students and young professionals, such as EF, Top Deck, and Contiki, whether you're looking for a trip abroad without studying. You may also volunteer or intern in a foreign country. Working on farms and small businesses are only a few of the programs available, and they all add something to your résumé that will impress employers in potential job interviews. If you can't find a program through your school or an organization that meets your needs, you can normally apply as an international student at a foreign university for only a semester if you want to do conventional study abroad.</p>
				<h4>Degree progress</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the whole point of college is (mostly) to get an education, it's important to keep your home university's degree program in mind while considering study abroad options. Is the school you're considering offering programs and classes that are close to those at home? Would your classes be able to be transferred back? Will you be able to complete your studies on time? If you speak with your academic counselor, who would most certainly have experience dealing with students who have studied abroad, it might be a little less daunting. If your courses don't quite align with your home university's requirements, you might be able to make up credits during the summer or winter breaks.</p>
				<h4>Language</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Another logistical stumbling block may be a language barrier. If you're studying Language or International Studies, you may want to try learning a new language. If you aren't, however, this concept can terrify you. Personally, I spent a semester abroad in Ireland, where everyone speaks English, but I have the utmost respect for those who choose to live, work, and learn in a country where English is not the primary language. So, when choosing where to go abroad, consider this: do you know enough of a foreign language to get by, or are you able to jump in head first and learn as you go?</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also organizations that have language-intensive services before or during your stay abroad, allowing you to have a more immersive experience. It's important to remember that many places have significant populations of English speakers who are near-fluent. However, talk to someone who has been there before or your school's study abroad coordinator, as relying on the fact that people in a foreign country understand your language is a big risk. Studying abroad is a significant decision in anyone's college career. Students frequently have an endless number of questions, but I hope I've answered some of them here or given you some more to consider. Regardless of where, where, or how you study abroad, one of the most important things to consider is to push yourself out of your comfort zone, but not too far; you are the best judge on this one. It's the most efficient way to learn and develop from your study abroad experience.</p>
