    			<h1>10 Tips on getting that Scholarship</h1>
    			<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of you would need financial assistance to fund your international education. A scholarship could mean the difference between studying and not studying for some students. For others, it simply helps with living expenses and offers a little extra to enjoy college life. </p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several scholarships available, and not all of them need you to demonstrate that you are the smartest person on the planet. They are, however, fiercely competitive. So, how can you ensure that you get the scholarship or bursary that you are entitled to?</p>	
				
				<ol>
				<li type="1"><b>You usually can’t apply for a scholarship until you have been accepted into the course</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">This may seem to be backward, but you must realize that you will afford your tuition and travel expenses without a scholarship. If you win a grant, you'll be able to pay off your local bank loan or have some extra spending money.</p>
				
				<li type="1"><b>It’s not going to cover everything</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">You cannot study for free. Even if you are fortunate enough to receive a full scholarship, you will still need to fund your travel, food, books, health care, phone calls, and entertainment.</p>
				
				<li type="1"><b>Look beyond your university</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Many websites have a comprehensive list of scholarships, including those offered by private foundations and government agencies in the host country and your own. Check to see if you're eligible; some programs have limitations based on ethnicity, course, or age.</p>
				
				<li type="1"><b>Every little bit helps</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">It's worth applying even if it's just for a small grant to help with the expense of your books. When you arrive, you'll have one less thing to think about.</p>
				
				<li type="1"><b>Apply for as many as you can</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it will take some time. However, it is unrestricted cash. As a result, make a list of all the scholarships for which you are eligible. Check that you have all of the necessary documentation to support your claim, and have someone else read your supporting essay or letter. It's always beneficial to hear someone else's point of view.</p>
				
				<li type="1"><b>Be confident</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't be shy if the application asks you to write a letter or write an essay outlining why you deserve the scholarship. List all of your related accomplishments, including community service, job experience, and honors, in addition to academic performance.p>

				<li type="1"><b>Avoid scholarship scams</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no such thing as a scholarship that is assured. An acceptance fee for a scholarship should never be needed. Unfortunately, some shady scholarship companies will simply vanish with your money.</p>

				<li type="1"><b>Allow plenty of time</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">You can plan your finances at least 18 months ahead of time if you want to start your course. However, once you've been accepted into the program, you may only have a limited amount of time to apply for a course-specific scholarship. Keep in contact with your Study link counselor and the University's foreign office to ensure you don't miss your deadline.</p>

				<li type="1"><b>Keep a record of all the documents</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">To get your visa sorted, you'll need proof of funds, which requires the scholarship offer or agreement.</p>

				<li type="1"><b>Have a backup plan</b>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Don't be discouraged if none of your applications are successful. Other options for funding your education exist. Student loans, assistance from friends and family, and business sponsorships are all options worth considering.</p>
