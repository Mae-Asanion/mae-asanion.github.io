    			<h1>How to Study Effectively from Home During Covid Pandemic</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
				
			<p style="text-align: justify">We've all seen the news and are fully informed regarding the world situation at the moment, so 
			we need to find efficient ways to study or work from home.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Online courses can be more helpful and are usually a lot cheaper than traditional 
			on-campus options. However, concentrating can be troublesome when you're in your own home; possibly with an adorable pet that
			needs attention, or maybe you simply need to wash the dishes or do your laundry. but, here are some key tips on the best way 
			to keep your study focus while taking classes from home:</p>
			
			<h2>Create a study schedule</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Set a time to log into your online classes every day. Utilize an alarm, a reminder, or whatever
			works for you. Appropriate time the management is necessary.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">You may have some regular lecture times you need to join in, however you ought to also make 
			time on your own end for review. This is especially important in case you're needed to review some of the course materials all
			alone.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Use calendars, post-it notes and reminders</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Online learning needs structure. Make a study calendar that will assist you with recalling the 
			important test dates or deadlines for submitting your homework's. You can save your calendar on your computer and or your 
			phone. You can even make a wall planner in case you're to a more visual type of person, which you can mark up and check each 
			time you study.</p>

			<h2>Take advantage of productivity apps</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">We live in the digital age. Whatever you need to do, there's most likely an application that
			can either do it for you or make it a lot simpler. These fantastic productivity extensions and applications make studying or
			working to a less of a hassle. They help to track your development, organize task, set reminders, or make other applications
			work how you want.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">There are a lot of productivity apps out there. Here are only a few examples:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Any.do, Todoist</li>
				<li>Google Calendar</li>
				<li>Gmail, Outlook</li>
				<li>Notion</li>
				<li>Evernote</li>
				<li>Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox</li>
				<li>Slack</li>
				<li>KanbanFlow, Trello</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Avoid distractions</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">If you want to work or study efficiently, it's important to keep off any item that can distract 
			you. For instance, attempt to leave you phone in another room (don't put it on silent, however, you would prefer not to miss 
			any calls) or behind your laptop or screen so you will not be tempted to look through your feed on Facebook or Instagram.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Staying away from social media or limiting the time you spend on it is especially important now 
			when the vast majority of the news is related with the new coronavirus. It's valuable to remain informed, however it is much 
			more helpful to keep some distance and deal with your emotional and mental wellbeing.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">If you're still tempted to use your phone, mute the notification from social media and other 
			non-essential applications. This way, you will not be diverted from your work by another like to that image you posted on your
			feed.</p>
			
			<h2>If it ain’t Lo-fi, it’s gotta go </h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Most people prefer tuning in to music while they are studying or working. but it shouldn't be 
			any sort of music. I mean, let's be honest: if it's our favorite song, it will make us dance or sing along.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Instrumental music can help you focus. For instance, check out Lo-fi music. There are a lot of
			YouTube Lo-fi playlists specifically made for studying. Numerous students use them when they're reviewing for their exams or
			working at projects.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Movie scores are still a thing, so consider your number one film and look into that OST on your
			music application – studying turns into an epic task when the GOT soundtrack is playing in the background. Other alternatives
			include any kind of music or playlist that helps you with releasing stress and focus on the task needing to be done.</p>
			
			<h2>Find a routine that works for you</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">While you're still enjoying your morning coffee, try to plan the main task of the day. Use your
			favourite time management application or sticky notes to choose when you will study, when you'll take breaks, and how you'll 
			reward yourself for each finished task.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Make sure your every day schedule isn't  completely different from a typical day outside of
			quarantine. Dress up in case you're going to classes or work. Your online presence matters, and you may need to turn on your 
			camera during meetings or calls. In this way, drop those fluffy pajamas and wear a cool outfit instead.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Also, don't be so hard on yourself. sometimes, you'll just complete 2 important task out of the
			5 set for the day. That is alright. Experiment and find a rhythm that works for you. Try the 2-day rule, for instance. It's a
			simple method to build healthy habits.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">How does it work? Suppose you need to study for 2 hours consistently every day. With the 2-day 
			rule, you can skip reading for one day, but the following day you need to return to your schedule. You can even skip 2 or 3 
			days in a week, simply make sure you don't connect them because that will break your successful streak.</p>

			<h2>Create a dedicated study space</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Make a place that you only associate with studying or working; it will help you with get into a 
			productive state easier. In spite of the fact that it's tempting, this should not be your bed or couch. I know, they are 
			pleasant places to warm up with your laptop, but they are definitely not good for your productivity.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">A simple table and a comfortable chair can get it done. However, make it hygge – light up a 
			candle or find the spot in your home that has the perfect lighting and appreciate the sun. Remember to customize the study 
			place. Add plants, your favourite figurines, pictures, or inspirational quotes – if that is your thing.</p>
			
			<h2>Dance like nobody’s watching...literally</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Sometimes working or attending to online courses from home can fool you into remaining in front
			of the computer for quite a long time. Make sure you're remaining as active and healthy as possible.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">You can use breaks to find activities that will really inspire you to get moving – it doesn't
			need to be a boring workout routine. Simply play that most loved inspiring song and, in the words of Lady Gaga, just dance.
			Dance like no one's watching – literally, since we're all keeping a social distance.</p>
			
			<h2>Stay in touch</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Studying on campus or working in an office can be especially fun if you enjoy socializing 
			during breaks. Why not do same while studying online working from home? </p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">You can create group chats where everybody can log in during breaks and take advantage of your 
			free time by talking with people you miss. Perhaps you need to show them your pet or your new funky hair style – simply make 
			you turn that camera on so you can keep it fun and personal.</p>
			
			<h2>Conclusions</h2>

			<p style="text-align: justify">See? Studying from home doesn't need to be exhausting and boring or unnecessarily complicated. 
			You can combine our suggestions with your own tips and tricks and make a schedule that would make even the most productive 
			entrepreneurs jealous.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify">Remember to take regular breaks and use your free time for the things that make you smile and
			lift your mood. It tends to be anything from cooking, playing computer games, completing an online course, and so on. There 
			are a ton of things you can do during the quarantine, so make this an amazing time for your development on all levels.</p>
