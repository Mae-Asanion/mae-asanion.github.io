    			<h1>Inspiration from a Graduated Student</h1>
    			<hr><br><br>
    			 <p> I have a good friend who is going to graduate this very month (May, 2021) and I asked them a few questions to give insights for students who are still studying and motivate us in finishing our studies. This friend of mine took up a computer science course and as someone who is currently taking up the information technology course, it is a very comforting idea that they were able to graduate despite having a much more difficult course and just gave me inspiration to keep going and finish this course </p>

                <p> I ran through a very quick interview with them and just asked them questions about their college life now that they’re almost graduating. </p>
                
                <p> <b> How does it feel now that you’re almost graduating? </b> </p>
                <p> “I feel relieved, mostly as I no longer have to worry about enormous amount of workload. It honestly feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. On the other hand, I do feel a little sad about leaving my friends. I am also excited about taking the next step and getting a job!” </p>

               <p> <b> Where do you see yourself 5 years from now? </b> </p>
               <p> “I see myself doing research in the area I’m currently pursuing or even a job if that doesn’t pan out. I would basically be making my way up the ladder.” </p>

               <p> <b> Sounds like you’re really interested in research. Is the career you currently want to pursue something you’ve had your eye on for a while? Or did you just like doing research all of a sudden even though you didn’t give it much thought before? </b> </p>
               <p> “I’ve had my eye on it for a while now. Worked a lot of projects on it too. It’s certainly the most interesting subject I’ve taken up. And yeah I could either go for development or research in that area there’s room for both and they usually go hand in hand.” </p>

               <p> <b> Share some memorable life lessons you’ve discovered when you were in college. </b> </p>
               <p> “One of the most important life lessons I’ve learnt in college is to create as many connections with people as you can. This can prove to be very valuable in the future.” </p>

               <p> <b> If you can give advice to your younger self, what would it be? </b> </p>
               <p> “I would advise myself to not be hasty in making big decisions.” </p>
               <p> <b> What made you say that? What hasty decision made you say that to your younger self? </b> </p>
               <p> “Thinking that I’m smart enough to take up engineering. But when I realized that, I was already too far gone in computer since and it was late to do something about it so I just finished what I started ” </p>
